I am a social/cultural psychologist in the UCDREAMS lab, supervised by Dr. Arianne Eason.\nAs a graduate student, I have cultivated two lines of research that shed light on the causes and consequences of omission, misrepresentation, and discrimination. In the first, I study bias towards, and experiences of, LGBTQ+ people. In the second, I collaborate with Dr. Stephanie Fryberg and the Research for Indigenous Action and Social Equity (RISE) center at Northwestern University to explore the omission of Native Peoples and its consequences.\nI began my research career as an undergraduate researcher at the University of British Columbia, where I conducted honors thesis projects with Dr. Frances Chen, and Dr. Toni Schmader. After graduating from UBC , I was Dr. Nicole Stephens’s lab manager at Northwestern University."
