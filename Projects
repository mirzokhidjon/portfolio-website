# The Sideline Post  
*Founder & Editor-in-Chief (Apr 2020 – Present)*  

The Sideline Post is the first-ever centralized platform for college athletes, like me, to share their stories in their own words, inspired by *The Players’ Tribune*.  
Since its inception during my freshman year at Penn, we have published **50+ full-length stories** from athletes around the world, representing a wide range of universities and sports.  

I currently serve as **Editor-in-Chief**, managing a small team of college students to maintain operations.

# @kcpmusic  
*Music Enthusiast | Content Creator*  

As a lover of all things music, I created an Instagram during high school to document my musical journey — improving guitar, piano, and drum skills, while also sharing new music discoveries.  

The account features:  
- Videos of me covering songs  
- Recurring lists of my favorite tracks  
- Personal insights on artists, albums, and the music industry — a bit like being a *Rolling Stone* writer!
